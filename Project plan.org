* Notes
** Frontend
- Each page in frontend to go into 'src/pages' with appropriate subdirectories
- React components to go into 'src/components'
- For each page, HTML and JS file to be named the same, and in same
  sub-directory. JS file is used to render React components in the HTML file
- CSS file to be named same as corresponding HTML file and should be imported in
  corresponding JS file
  Ex: import './index.css' (in index.js for index.html)
- Icons to be placed in 'src/assets/icons', and url to be given in the HTML file
  itself, with assets as the root directory
  Ex: <link rel="icon" src="assets/icons/icon.png"> (not "../assets/icons/icon.png")
- Other images to be imported in js (for use in React components) using relative
  path
  Ex: For component Main.jsx in 'src/components', use "import
  '../assets/images/image.png' as image"
- JS and JSX components to be imported without extension i.e, "import Comp from
  'components/comp'" instead of "import Comp from 'components/comp.jsx'"

** Backend
- All api route handling to be done in 'server.js'
- All routes need to be prefixed with 'api'
  Ex: '/api/login'
- Each route group's functions to be defined in one file in 'routes', and
  imported in server.js
  Ex: Functions for 'user/login', 'user/register' etc. should be in one file
- Models for database to be defined in separate files in 'database/models'
- Database connection to be defined in 'database' folder (say database.js)
